// Ternary Operator

// The ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise way of writing conditional expressions by a question mark (?), an expression to execute if the condition is true, followed by a colon (:), and an expression to execute if the condition is false

// condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
