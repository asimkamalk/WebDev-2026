# Full Web Development Journey (HTML → MERN Stack) | 2026

This repository represents my complete web development learning journey, starting from the fundamentals of web development and progressing toward advanced full-stack applications using the MERN Stack. The goal is to build strong foundations, follow modern development practices, and become job-ready for 2026 and beyond.

The learning path begins with core frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then advances to utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS. TypeScript is introduced to ensure type safety, scalability, and maintainability across both frontend and backend codebases. The journey continues into React for building dynamic user interfaces, followed by backend development using Node.js and Express, and database management with MongoDB.

This repository focuses on real-world skills, clean architecture, scalable code, and production-level applications.

---

## Technologies Covered

Frontend fundamentals include HTML5, CSS3, responsive design, modern layouts using Flexbox and Grid, and JavaScript (ES6+). Styling is handled using Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent UI development.

Frontend development is built with React, Vite, React Router, modern state management solutions, and TypeScript to ensure robust and predictable applications.

Backend development uses Node.js with Express or Fastify, RESTful APIs, authentication and authorization using JWT, and secure environment configuration.

Database management is handled using MongoDB with Mongoose for schema design, validation, and performance optimization.

Developer tooling includes Git, GitHub, ESLint, Prettier, Postman, Docker basics, and CI/CD fundamentals.
